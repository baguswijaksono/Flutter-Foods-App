## What are This Project?
Hi Fella, I'm Bagus. I'm a student who comes from a small town in the province of Central Java. Maybe you are wondering what kind of application project this actually is. So Mbadogtify is an application that I developed for the final project in my mobile programming course. Mbadog is a word that comes from the Javanese language and means to eat. The word "Mbadog" is included in the Rough Ngoko Javanese language category. Mbadog means to "eat something or put staple food in the mouth and chew and swallow it." This project uses the Dart programming language and the Flutter framework. This application can be used by all of you to view information about a food, whether it's nutrition information, the ingredients used to make the dish, or how to cook the food.

## Information architecture
Information architecture provides the blueprint of the design; it is the foundation of the user experience. UX needs information architecture in order to create an interface that is pleasant to interact with. Put another way: UX aims at making a user comfortable, while information architecture tries to understand a userâ€™s desires.
