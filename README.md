## What are Discord Music Bots?

Project ini dibuat untuk Project akhir semester 3 yang dibuat dengan bahasa pemrograman dart dan framework Flutter 

A discord music bot is a program that plays audio from a specific website at the user's request. Even though they all do the same primary function (play music), some bots offer more features than others.
For example, you can find discord music bots designed for servers that want to be as automated as possible. These come equipped with several different features such as trivia, polls, moderation, and even mini-games, amongst other things.
